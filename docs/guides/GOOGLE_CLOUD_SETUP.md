## ðŸ”’ **Security Best Practices**

### Keep Credentials Secure

- **Never share** your credentials file
- **Don't commit** it to version control (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- **Store securely** on your local machine
- **Backup safely** if needed

### File Permissions

- Set appropriate file permissions (readable only by you)
- On Unix/Linux: `chmod 600 google-credentials.json`

### Environment Variables (Alternative)

Instead of a file, you can use environment variables:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/google-credentials.json"
```

## ðŸ’° **Cost Information**

### Free Tier

- **4 million characters per month** are free
- This is typically enough for testing and small projects
- No credit card required for free tier

### Paid Usage

- After free tier: ~$4 per 1 million characters
- Very cost-effective for most use cases
- You can set up billing alerts to control costs

### Cost Examples

- **1,000 sentences** (~20,000 characters): **FREE**
- **10,000 sentences** (~200,000 characters): **FREE**
- **100,000 sentences** (~2 million characters): **FREE**

3. Provide the path to your `google-credentials.json`

4. The wizard will validate your credentials

### Test with Sample Data

1. Run the main processor:
   ```bash
   python tts_batch_processor.py examples_en.txt --credentials google-credentials.json --max-sentences 3
   ```

2. Check that audio files are generated in the output directory

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

#### "File not found" error
- Ensure the credentials file is in the correct location
